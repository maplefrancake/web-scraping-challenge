# web-scraping-challenge

## Georgia Tech Data Analytics Bootcamp - Module 12 Challenge
### Mission to Mars!!

As part of this week's module, we were challenged to build a Flask application that scrapes various websites for data related to Mars and displays all that info in a single HTML page. To start off, we did our work in a Jupyter Notebook so we could 'prove the math' before rendering it into HTML.

We split the work up into four sections:
1: Scrape the Mars News Site and get the latest article's title and teaser text.
2: Scrape the Mars Space Images Site and get the featured image.
3: Scrape the Mars Facts webpage and use Pandas to scrape the table containing facts about Mars.
4: Scrape the Mars Hemispheres Site to get the images of each hemisphere.

Once these tasks were complete, we had to translate it all into a script, which we could call at the push of a button. In addition, we would need the root route to query our Mongo database and pass the data we gathered with the script into an HTML template to display our data. Finally, with the help of Bootstrap, we could render the data into HTML.
